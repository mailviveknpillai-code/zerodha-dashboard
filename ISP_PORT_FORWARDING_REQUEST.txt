Subject: Request to Enable Port Forwarding on My Router

Dear [ISP Name] Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with enabling port forwarding on my internet connection. I am a software developer and need to configure port forwarding for API callback functionality, but the router configuration interface is not allowing me to make these changes.

**Account Details:**
- Account Holder Name: [Your Name]
- Account Number/Customer ID: [Your Account Number]
- Service Address: [Your Address]
- Public IP Address: 122.167.184.90
- Router Model: DZSI H660GM-A (Model: H660GM-A)
- Router MAC Address: 30:4F:75:B2:91:18

**Technical Request:**
I need either port forwarding OR DMZ configured with the following settings:

**Option 1: Port Forwarding (Preferred)**
- External Port: 8080 (TCP)
- Internal IP Address: 192.168.1.8
- Internal Port: 8080 (TCP)
- Protocol: TCP
- Purpose: ICICI Direct Breeze API OAuth callback endpoint

**Option 2: DMZ (Alternative)**
- DMZ Host IP Address: 192.168.1.8
- This will expose all ports from my PC to the internet
- Purpose: Same as above if port forwarding cannot be enabled

**Issue Description:**
When I attempt to configure these settings through the router's web interface (http://192.168.1.1), I receive the following errors:
- Port Forwarding: "Cannot set port forwarding common"
- DMZ Configuration: "Could not set Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)!"

This indicates the router is ISP-managed and locked from user configuration.

I have verified that:
1. My public IP address (122.167.184.90) is not behind CGNAT
2. Windows Firewall is configured to allow port 8080
3. The service is running locally and accessible at localhost:8080
4. UPnP is enabled on the router but does not expose port mapping API
5. Both Port Forwarding and DMZ configuration interfaces are blocked

**What I Need:**
Please help me by doing ONE of the following:
1. **Configure port forwarding remotely** for external port 8080 → internal IP 192.168.1.8 port 8080 (TCP), OR
2. **Enable DMZ remotely** for host IP 192.168.1.8, OR
3. **Unlock the router configuration** so I can configure port forwarding/DMZ myself, OR
4. **Put the router in bridge/passthrough mode** so I can use my own router

**Business Justification:**
I am integrating with ICICI Direct's Breeze API for financial trading applications. The API requires a publicly accessible callback URL (http://122.167.184.90:8080/api/breeze/callback) that is already registered with ICICI Direct and cannot be changed. Without port forwarding, I cannot complete the OAuth authentication flow required for this integration.

**Urgency:**
This is blocking critical development work. I would greatly appreciate if this could be resolved within 24-48 hours.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if a technician needs remote access to my router to configure this.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

TECHNICAL NOTES FOR SUPPORT STAFF:
- Router login: http://192.168.1.1 (admin credentials)
- Router LAN IP: 192.168.1.1
- Client PC LAN IP: 192.168.1.8 (requires DHCP reservation for stability)

**Option 1 - Port Forwarding Configuration:**
- WAN Interface: WAN1
- Required NAT rule: WAN:8080 → 192.168.1.8:8080 (TCP)
- Protocol: TCP (or TCP/UDP)
- Navigation: Firewall Setup → NAT Forwarding → Port Forwarding

**Option 2 - DMZ Configuration:**
- DMZ Host IP: 192.168.1.8
- WAN Interface: WAN1
- Navigation: Firewall Setup → NAT Forwarding → DMZ

**Verification:**
- Windows Firewall: Already configured to allow TCP 8080
- Local service verified working: curl http://localhost:8080/api/breeze/status returns HTTP 200
- External test URL: http://122.167.184.90:8080/api/breeze/status
