Subject: Port Forwarding Request for Business Application - Account [YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER]

Dear Airtel Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with enabling port forwarding on my fiber broadband connection for a critical business application.

**Account Details:**
- Account Number: [YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER]
- Service Address: [YOUR ADDRESS]
- Connection Type: Fiber Broadband
- Router Model: DASAN H660GM-A (Model: DPW-G-P-66GMAZ-A3)
- Public IP Address: 122.167.184.90
- Local PC IP Address: 192.168.1.6

**Business Requirement:**
I need to enable external access to port 8080 on my local server for ICICI Direct Breeze API integration. This is required for automated stock trading operations through my registered brokerage account.

**Technical Details:**
- Port Required: 8080 (TCP)
- Protocol: HTTP
- Purpose: API callback endpoint for ICICI Direct Breeze API
- Redirect URL (registered with ICICI): http://122.167.184.90:8080/api/breeze/callback

**Current Issue:**
I have configured port forwarding and DMZ on my router (WAN2 interface) as follows:
- Port Forwarding Rule: External 8080 â†’ Internal 192.168.1.6:8080
- DMZ Host: 192.168.1.6 (enabled on WAN2)
- Windows Firewall: Configured to allow port 8080
- Local access: Working (verified via 192.168.1.6:8080)
- External access: Blocked (122.167.184.90:8080 times out)

Despite correct router configuration, external connections to port 8080 are being blocked. This suggests ISP-level port blocking or firewall restrictions.

**Request:**
Please assist with ONE of the following solutions:

1. **[Preferred] Unblock port 8080** on my connection to allow incoming traffic
   - OR configure port forwarding on your network equipment if applicable

2. **Unlock my router** so I can configure advanced settings if currently restricted

3. **Provide alternative solution** if port 8080 cannot be unblocked due to security policies

**Business Impact:**
This integration is essential for my trading operations. Without port access, I cannot complete the OAuth authentication flow required by ICICI Direct's Breeze API, preventing me from executing automated trades.

**Verification:**
Once resolved, I can verify functionality by accessing http://122.167.184.90:8080/api/breeze/status from an external network.

Please prioritize this request as it's blocking critical business operations. I'm available for any technical discussions or remote support sessions.

Thank you for your assistance.
